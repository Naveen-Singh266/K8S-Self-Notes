What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform.
It helps you automate:
Deployment
Scaling
Networking
Self-healing
Management of containerized applications

Why Kubernetes?
1)Containers (like Docker) solve packaging → "ship anywhere".
2)But in real-world systems:
i) Apps need hundreds of containers running across multiple servers.
ii) You need to handle failures, scaling, updates, and networking.
3)Doing this manually is impossible → Kubernetes automates it.

Key Features of Kubernetes
Automatic Scaling → Add/remove containers as needed.
Self-Healing → Restarts failed containers, reschedules on healthy nodes.
Load Balancing & Service Discovery → Ensures traffic is distributed evenly.
Rolling Updates & Rollbacks → Zero-downtime deployments.
Storage Orchestration → Manage volumes, cloud storage.
Infrastructure Abstraction → Works on any environment (cloud, on-prem, hybrid).

Analogy:
Think of Kubernetes as an Air Traffic Controller:
1)Containers are airplanes (apps).
2)Nodes are airports (machines).
3)Kubernetes (ATC) decides:
i)Which plane lands at which airport (scheduling).
ii)Keeps track of all planes (monitoring).
iii)Redirects planes if a runway is closed (self-healing).
iv)Ensures passengers (users) always get the correct flights (services).
So Kubernetes = Orchestrator of containers.

Kubernetes Architecture:
Kubernetes has a Master-Worker Architecture (also called Control Plane – Worker Nodes).
1. Control Plane (Master Components)
The brain of Kubernetes – makes global decisions about the cluster (like scheduling, scaling)
Key Components:
i)API Server (kube-apiserver)
Entry point for all commands (kubectl / API calls).
Exposes the Kubernetes API (REST interface).
Validates and processes requests.
Analogy: Like a reception desk – all requests go through it.

ii) etcd
A key-value store that stores cluster state & configuration.
Stores info about Pods, Nodes, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.
Highly available, consistent.
Analogy: Like the cluster’s database or memory.

iii) Controller Manager
Runs controllers that watch the cluster state and make changes.
Examples:
Node Controller → handles node failures.
ReplicaSet Controller → ensures desired pod count.
Job Controller → runs batch jobs.
Analogy: Like a supervisor making sure everything is as planned.

iv) Scheduler
Decides which node a Pod should run on.
Considers resource availability (CPU, memory), affinity rules, taints/tolerations.
Analogy: Like an HR manager assigning employees (pods) to desks (nodes)

2. Worker Node (Data Plane):
The muscles of Kubernetes – actually run the applications.
Key Components:
i) Kubelet
An agent running on each worker node.
Talks to the API server, ensures pods are running as expected.
Reports node & pod status.
Analogy: Like an employee following instructions from the manager.

ii) Container Runtime
Software to run containers (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O).
Pulls container images and starts containers.
Analogy: Like the engine that makes the car (container) run.

iii)Kube-proxy
Handles networking on each node.
Ensures services can talk to pods via cluster networking.
Implements load-balancing and routing.
Analogy: Like a telephone operator who connects calls.

3. Add-ons (Supporting Components)
DNS (CoreDNS) → Service discovery inside cluster.
Dashboard → Web UI for Kubernetes.
Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, EFK) → Observability tools.

High-Level Flow:
You run: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
API Server validates request.
Data stored in etcd.
Scheduler decides which node will run the Pod.
Kubelet on that node creates Pod & asks Container Runtime to run it.
Kube-proxy ensures networking works.

In short:
Control Plane = Brains (decision making).
Worker Nodes = Muscles (do the actual work).

Kubernetes Core Concepts:
1. Cluster
2. Node
3. Pod
4. ReplicaSet
5. Deployment
6. Service
7. Namespace
8. ConfigMap & Secret
9. Volume
10. Ingress

1. Cluster
A Kubernetes cluster is the foundation – it’s a collection of nodes (machines).
It has:
Master (Control Plane) → makes decisions (like a manager).
Worker Nodes → run the actual applications (like employees)
Analogy: Imagine a company. The CEO (control plane) makes decisions, and employees (nodes) do the actual work.

2. Node
A node is a physical or virtual machine in the cluster.
Each node runs:
Kubelet → communicates with control plane.
Container Runtime (Docker/Containerd) → runs containers.
Kube-proxy → handles networking.
Analogy: A node is like an employee desk with all tools (runtime, proxy) ready to work.

3. Pod
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
A pod can contain one or more containers that share storage, network, and runtime.
Pods are ephemeral (they come and go).
Analogy: A pod is like a house where one or more people (containers) live together, sharing the same Wi-Fi (network) and kitchen (storage).

4. ReplicaSet
Ensures a specific number of pod replicas are always running.
If a pod dies, it automatically creates a new one.
Analogy: Like having a backup generator – if one fails, another starts automatically.

5. Deployment
Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
You tell Kubernetes: “I want 3 pods with version 2 of the app”, and it ensures it happens.
Supports rolling updates and rollbacks.
Analogy: Like a project manager – you say the goal, and it manages everything to get there.

6. Service
A stable networking endpoint for a set of pods (since pod IPs are dynamic).
Types:
ClusterIP → accessible only inside the cluster.
NodePort → accessible via <NodeIP>:<Port>.
LoadBalancer → exposes externally via cloud load balancer.
Headless Service → no load-balancing, gives pod IPs directly.
Analogy: A restaurant number – even if waiters (pods) change, customers always call the same number (service).

7. Namespace
A way to divide cluster resources logically.
Used for multi-tenancy, resource isolation, or organizing environments (dev, test, prod).
Analogy: Like folders in a computer – they separate files (resources) into groups.

8. ConfigMap & Secret
ConfigMap → stores non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., environment variables).
Secret → stores sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) in base64 encoded form.
Analogy:
ConfigMap = A notice board (anyone can read).
Secret = A locker (only those with permission can open

9. Volume
Provides storage to Pods.
Types: emptyDir, hostPath, PersistentVolume (PV), PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
Analogy: Like a USB drive you plug into a computer (pod) to store files.

10. Ingress
Manages external access (HTTP/HTTPS) to services.
Acts like a reverse proxy or API gateway.
Analogy: Like a hotel receptionist who directs guests (requests) to the correct room (service).

| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cluster**    | Collection of nodes (machines) running Kubernetes.       | A company with many employees (nodes).                       |
| **Node**       | A worker machine (VM/physical) that runs pods.           | An employee’s desk with all tools.                           |
| **Pod**        | Smallest deployable unit; runs 1+ containers.            | A house where people (containers) share kitchen & Wi-Fi.     |
| **ReplicaSet** | Ensures desired number of pods are always running.       | Backup generator – replaces when one fails.                  |
| **Deployment** | Manages ReplicaSets; supports rolling updates/rollbacks. | Project manager ensuring team runs latest plan.              |
| **Service**    | Stable network endpoint to access pods.                  | Restaurant phone number – stays same even if waiters change. |

| **Secret**     | Stores sensitive data (passwords, keys).                 | Locker – only authorized can open.                           |
| **Volume**     | Provides storage to pods.                                | USB drive plugged into computer.                             |
| **Ingress**    | Manages external HTTP/HTTPS traffic into cluster.        | Hotel receptionist directing guests to rooms.                |


Labels, Selectors and Annotations

Labels: It is key-value pair attached to kubernetes objects such as pods, nodes and controllers. It is used to organise objects by identitying similar attributes and added at the time of object creation. It can be added/modified later in objects lifecycle.

Selectors: It's core grouping mechanism in Kubernetes. User/applications can pick a group of objects by their labels using selectors.
multiple labels can be used with secectors using a comma separator, whcich acts as a logical AND (&&) operator.
                                   Or
A selector is used to identify a set of resources (like Pods) by matching labels. It's a core concept that helps controllers (e.g., Deployment, ReplicaSet, Service) manage and interact with specific groups of Pods.

There are two type of selectors.
1) Equality based selector 
2) Set-based selector 

1) Equality-based Selector: 
They allow you to select resources based on exact matches of key-value pairs.
✅ Supported Operators:
= (equal to)
== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)

2) Set-based selector:
These allow more complex filtering using sets of values.
✅ Supported Operators:
In
NotIn
Exists (key exists, value doesn't matter)
DoesNotExist

Annotations: Annotations in Kubernetes are key-value pairs attached to objects (like Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.), similar to labels, but used for storing non-identifying metadata.
🔸 Unlike labels (which are used for selection and grouping), annotations are not used to select or group resources.
They are purely for storing informational data or configuration that doesn't affect the operation of the object directly.

🏢 Real-Life Analogy: Office Employees in a Company
Imagine you're managing employees in a large office.
You want to group, filter, and keep extra notes about them.

🏷️ Labels → Employee ID Tags
Each employee wears a badge (ID card) with:
Department: Engineering
Role: Backend
Location: Bangalore
These are labels.

📌 You use these for grouping:
"Show me all employees in the Engineering department, working in Bangalore."
🔍 Selectors → HR Filters
HR wants to filter employees for a training program.
They say:
“Select all employees where Role = Backend and Location = Bangalore.”
That’s a selector — a rule used to pick the right people based on their badges (labels).

📝 Annotations → Sticky Notes on Employee Desk
Now, let’s say you want to record extra details:
PerformanceReviewDate: "2025-07-30"
EmergencyContact: "9876543210"
LaptopSerialNumber: "Dell-12345"

These aren’t visible on the ID badge, and not used for grouping,
but they’re important notes for HR, Admin, or IT.
That’s exactly what annotations are — extra metadata for tools or humans.

💡 Summary Table:
Concept	Real-Life Analogy	Purpose
Label	Badge info (department, role)	For identifying and grouping people
Selector	HR filter rule (e.g., select all engineers)	To find specific people using label info
Annotation	Sticky note on desk (extra notes)	For storing extra info, not used for filter
🎯 Visual Reminder:
🏷️ Label = Badge
🔍 Selector = Filter used by HR
📝 Annotation = Sticky note on the desk

Services:
A Service is a stable way to expose and access a group of Pods, even when those Pods change (restart, reschedule, etc.).
It connects users or other apps to your application without worrying about Pod IPs, which change frequently.

🏢 Real-Life Analogy: Office Reception Desk
Imagine a large office building (like a company HQ).
Inside the building are employees (Pods) working in different departments.
Now, if someone wants to meet someone from the Sales Department, they don’t go room by room asking for “someone from Sales.”
Instead, they go to the Reception Desk.

🧑‍💼 Reception Desk = Kubernetes Service
You (the user or client) ask the reception:
"I want to speak with someone from Sales."
The receptionist (Service) knows exactly:
Which Sales team members (Pods) are currently available.
Even if someone from Sales goes out and another joins, the reception handles it.
You don’t need to know who exactly is inside or their room numbers (IP addresses).

| Real-Life       | Kubernetes                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Employee        | Pod                        |
| Reception Desk  | Service                    |
| Department Name | Label (e.g., `app: sales`) |
| Visitor Request | External Client Request    |
| Room Numbers    | Pod IPs (dynamic)          |

🍕 Another Quick Analogy: Food Court
Imagine a food court in a mall:
Multiple kitchen workers (Pods) make pizzas.
You place an order at the pizza counter (Service).
You don’t know which chef made your pizza — the counter routes it internally.

In Kubernetes, there are 4 main types of Services, each used for different networking needs:

| Service Type        | Description                                                                   | Real-Life Analogy                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. ClusterIP**    | Default type. Exposes the service **internally** within the cluster.          | Office intercom: Only employees (Pods) inside the office can talk to each other.        |
| **2. NodePort**     | Exposes the service on a **static port on each Node's IP** (external access). | Security gate: Visitors (users) come through a fixed gate (port) to enter the building. |
| **3. LoadBalancer** | Exposes the service using an **external cloud load balancer**.                | Front-desk at a mall with automated routing to right shops.                             |
| **4. ExternalName** | Maps a service name to an **external DNS name**.                              | A receptionist forwarding your request to a **different company** (like `gmail.com`).   |

1. ClusterIP (default)
Internal-only access within the Kubernetes cluster.
Used when you don’t need to expose the app outside, e.g., a backend service for frontend.

2. NodePort
Makes the app accessible from outside the cluster via <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
Port range: 30000–32767
Simple way to expose a service for testing.

3. LoadBalancer
Works only in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure).
Provides a single external IP to access your app.
Best for production with external users.

4. ExternalName
Used to map a service to an external DNS name, like example.com.
Useful when accessing external services like a remote database or API.

Easy Analogy Recap:
| Service Type | Analogy                              | Traffic Comes From       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| ClusterIP    | Office intercom                      | Internal cluster only    |
| NodePort     | Security gate with fixed port        | External via Node IP     |
| LoadBalancer | Official building entrance           | External via public IP   |
| ExternalName | Receptionist calling another company | External DNS redirection |

Q1: What is a Kubernetes Controller?
A Kubernetes Controller is a control loop that watches the state of cluster resources and automatically makes changes to reach the desired state defined by the user.

Q2: Can you give an example?
If I create a Deployment that asks for 3 replicas (Pods), the Deployment controller checks how many Pods are currently running. If one crashes or gets deleted, the controller will create a new one automatically to maintain 3 replicas.

Q3: What is a reconciliation loop?
It’s the internal process that keeps checking the actual state vs. desired state, and keeps “reconciling” them. It’s like an infinite loop that continuously repairs the system if it drifts away from the spec.

Q4: How is a controller different from an operator?
Controllers are built-in to Kubernetes and handle standard resources like Pods, Deployments, etc.
Operators are custom controllers created to manage custom resources (CRDs) with application-specific logic — like for managing databases (e.g., PostgreSQL Operator).

| Controller  | Watches        | Ensures What?                    |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Deployment  | ReplicaSets    | Pod updates & rollout management |
| ReplicaSet  | Pods           | Fixed number of replicas         |
| StatefulSet | Pods + Volumes | Stable identity and ordering     |
| DaemonSet   | Nodes          | One Pod per node                 |
| Job         | Pods           | Completes task once successfully |
| CronJob     | Time Schedule  | Starts Jobs on a schedule        |
| HPA         | Metrics        | Autoscale Pods based on usage    |

Types of Controllers in Kubernetes: Kubernetes has several built-in controllers, each designed to manage specific kinds of resources.
Major Types of Kubernetes Controllers (with Easy Analogies)
| Controller                             | Purpose                                  | Real-Life Analogy                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. ReplicaSet**                      | Ensures a fixed number of identical Pods | 🪑 A manager ensuring there are always 5 workers at their desks             |
| **2. Deployment**                      | Manages ReplicaSets & app updates        | 📦 A logistics supervisor: sends versioned packages & rolls them out safely |
| **3. StatefulSet**                     | Manages stateful apps (e.g., databases)  | 🏠 Hotel with fixed room numbers: each guest (Pod) has a permanent room     |
| **4. DaemonSet**                       | Ensures 1 Pod per Node                   | 🛡️ Security guard on every floor of a building                             |
| **5. Job**                             | Runs a task once and exits on completion | 📃 Submitting an exam paper once: run it and you’re done                    |
| **6. CronJob**                         | Runs Jobs on a schedule                  | ⏰ Alarm clock that triggers a task every morning                            |
| **7. HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** | Scales Pods up/down based on usage       | ⚖️ Automatic fan that adjusts speed based on temperature                    |

1. ReplicaSet
Goal: Always maintain a specific number of identical Pods
Analogy: A classroom with 3 chairs — if one student leaves, a new one is seated.

2. ReplicationController:
A ReplicationController is a controller in Kubernetes that ensures a specified number of identical Pods are running at all times.
Difference: ReplicationController vs ReplicaSet

| Feature                  | **ReplicationController** | **ReplicaSet**                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pod selector matching    | Only **equality-based**   | Supports **equality + set-based** (`In`, `NotIn`, etc.) |
| Recommended usage        | ❌ Deprecated              | ✅ Preferred                                             |
| Used by which controller | Not used by Deployments   | Used **by Deployments internally**                      |

Analogy:
🪑 ReplicationController = Old manager who can only say: "Give me exactly 3 of these specific workers."
🪑 ReplicaSet = New manager who can say: "Give me 3 of any workers who match these flexible labels."

3. Deployment
Goal: Manage app versions, rollbacks, and rolling updates
Analogy: Like a delivery manager rolling out software version 1.2 → 1.3 → rollback if there's a bug.

4. StatefulSet
Goal: Handle ordered, named, and stable Pods
Analogy: Hotel rooms — guest db-0, db-1 always go back to their own rooms.

5. DaemonSet
Goal: Run one Pod on each Node (for log collection, monitoring, etc.)
Analogy: A security guard or cleaning staff assigned to every building floor.

6. Job
Goal: Run once until success, then stop
Analogy: Submitting a one-time task like generating a monthly report.

7. CronJob
Goal: Schedule recurring jobs
Analogy: Your daily 6 AM alarm to run a task — like sending daily sales reports.

8. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
Goal: Automatically scale Pods up/down based on CPU/memory
Analogy: A smart air conditioner that speeds up when it’s hot, slows down when it's cool.,

9. TTL (Time to Live): TTL controller automatically cleans up finished resources (like Jobs) after a specified time.

Why TTL needed:
Let’s say you run 1,000 short-lived Jobs per day (e.g., image processing, reports, backups).
Without TTL, every completed Job stays in the cluster — causing:
Waste of memory
Harder to manage resources
Slower kubectl get jobs response
With TTL, you can say:
"Delete this Job automatically 5 minutes after it finishes

TTL Controller Key Points:
| Feature            | Description                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Works with         | **Job** and **CronJob Jobs**                    |
| Field used in YAML | `ttlSecondsAfterFinished`                       |
| What it does       | Deletes Job object after it completes + timeout |

What is Ingress in Kubernetes?
In Kubernetes, Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services in a cluster, usually HTTP or HTTPS traffic.
It acts as a traffic controller that decides which requests go to which service, based on rules you define (like URLs or hostnames).

Why do we need Ingress?
Without Ingress:
To expose a service outside the cluster, you’d need to use NodePort or LoadBalancer for each service.
This wastes IPs, ports, and makes management messy.
With Ingress:
You can have one entry point for all your services.
You can route requests based on hostnames (e.g., app1.example.com, app2.example.com) or paths (/login, /shop).
You can handle SSL/TLS termination in one place.

How Ingress Works
Ingress Resource – YAML configuration with rules for routing.
Ingress Controller – The actual software (like Nginx Ingress Controller, Traefik, HAProxy) that implements those rules.
Service & Pods – Backend applications that receive traffic.
Client → Ingress Controller → Service → Pod

Analogy — Ingress is like a receptionist at an office building
Imagine:
You have an office building (Kubernetes cluster).
Inside, there are different departments (services: Payments, Orders, Inventory).
Visitors (users) come to the main reception desk (Ingress Controller).
The receptionist (Ingress rules) checks:
Who you want to meet (hostname/path in the request)
Which department they belong to (which service to forward the request to)
Then directs you to the correct room (Pod).
Without a receptionist:
Every department would need their own door (NodePort/LoadBalancer for each service).
Visitors would have to know exactly where to go — messy and confusing.
With a receptionist (Ingress):
One main door.
Easy to redirect traffic.
Can also handle security (SSL/TLS) at the reception desk.

Key Features of Ingress
Path-based routing: /login → one service, /shop → another.
Host-based routing: app1.example.com vs app2.example.com.
SSL termination: Manage HTTPS certificates centrally.
Single entry point: One load balancer for all apps.

Ingress Controller: An Ingress Controller in Kubernetes is the actual traffic manager that makes your Ingress rules work.
Definition
An Ingress is just a set of rules (YAML configuration) describing how external traffic should reach your services.
But those rules do nothing on their own.
The Ingress Controller is a special pod (or set of pods) that watches those rules and configures a real load balancer/reverse proxy (like Nginx, Traefik, HAProxy, AWS ALB, etc.) to enforce them.
How It Works
You write an Ingress YAML with hostnames, paths, and backend service names.
Kubernetes stores that object in its API.
The Ingress Controller sees the new Ingress object and:
Translates it into proxy/load balancer configuration.
Listens on the entry point (node ports, cloud LB, etc.).
Routes requests to the correct service based on your rules.
Without Ingress Controller
Your Ingress YAML is just a piece of paper with instructions, but no one is there to follow them.

Analogy
Think of Ingress as a traffic signboard telling drivers where to go.
The Ingress Controller is the traffic police officer who actually reads the sign and directs the cars (HTTP requests) to the right street (service).
Without the officer, the signboard is useless — drivers wouldn’t know where to go.

Popular Ingress Controllers
Nginx Ingress Controller (most common and feature-rich)
Traefik
HAProxy
Kong
Istio Gateway (service mesh style)
AWS ALB Ingress Controller (cloud-native)

Key Points for Interviews
Ingress = rules.
Ingress Controller = software that enforces those rules.
It’s deployed as a pod inside the cluster.
You can have multiple controllers in the same cluster (but each Ingress is linked to one controller via annotations).

liveness probes: The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container.
Readiness probes: The kubelet uses readiness probes to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.A Pod is considered ready when its Ready condition is true. When a Pod is not ready, it is removed from Service load balancers.

Types of Probe(Liveness/Readiness):
1) HTTPGetAction: The probe sends out an HTTP Get request to container and is considered successful if response is >=200 and <400
2) TCPSocketAction: This type of probe initiates a TCP connection to a specified port of the container. If the connection is established, the diagnostic is deemed successful. 
3) ExecAction: Like the name suggests, ths probe executes a command inside of the container. If the status code return 0, the diagnostic is successful.

Restart Policy:
Restart Policy in Kubernetes defines what Kubernetes should do when a container inside a Pod stops running.
It tells Kubernetes when to restart a container and has three possible values:
1) Always
Restart the container no matter how it exited (success or failure).
Default for Pods managed by a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or DaemonSet.
Example: Web servers that must always be running.
2) OnFailure-
Restart the container only if it fails (non-zero exit code).
Example: Batch jobs that should retry if something goes wrong.
3) Never-
Do not restart the container, no matter how it exited.
Example: Debugging Pods or one-time scripts

Real-life analogy:
Restart policy is like your alarm clock settings:
Always → Rings every day, no matter what happened yesterday.
OnFailure → Rings only if you overslept yesterday.
Never → You’re on your own; no alarm.

Kubernetes Scheduler:
The Kubernetes Scheduler is the component that decides which node in your cluster will run a newly created pod.
It doesn’t actually run the pod — it just makes the placement decision based on:
Resource requirements (CPU, memory)
Node availability
Taints/tolerations
Node affinity/anti-affinity rules

Analogy:
Imagine you run a large hotel chain 🏨:
Hotel rooms = Nodes in your Kubernetes cluster
Guests = Pods you want to deploy
Front desk receptionist = Kubernetes Scheduler
When a guest arrives:
The receptionist doesn’t carry the guest to the room — they decide which room is best based on availability, size, and special requests.
They check:
Is the room free? (Node capacity)
Is it a smoking or non-smoking room? (Node labels & taints)
Is it close to the pool like the guest asked? (Affinity rules)
After deciding, the receptionist hands over the assignment to housekeeping (Kubelet) to prepare the room and move the guest in.

Flow:
[Pod Created] → [Scheduler Detects] → [Filter Nodes] → [Score Nodes] → [Select Node] → [Bind to Node] → [Kubelet Runs Pod]
								
								Or
								
Here’s a short summary of the Kubernetes Scheduler flow from your diagram:
kubectl sends the pod request to the API Server.
API Server stores it in etcd; the pod has no node assigned yet.
Scheduler detects the unscheduled pod, filters and scores nodes, then picks the best one.
API Server updates the pod’s node assignment.
Kubelet on that node pulls the image and runs the pod via the Container Runtime.
kube-proxy updates networking rules (IP tables) so the pod can communicate.
In short: kubectl → API Server → Scheduler → Node’s Kubelet → Pod running with networking ready.
kubectl → API Server → etcd → Controller Manager → Scheduler (filter + score) → API Server → Kubelet (on chosen node) → Container Runtime Engine → kube-proxy & IP tables → Pod Running

Pod Priority :
In Kubernetes, Pod Priority is a value that determines the importance of a pod compared to others, especially during scheduling and eviction.
Key Points
Priority is set through a PriorityClass object.
Higher-priority pods are scheduled before lower-priority pods if resources are limited.
During resource pressure, lower-priority pods can be evicted to make space for higher-priority ones.
Default priority is 0 if none is set.

Analogy:
Imagine a hospital 🏥:
Beds = Node resources (CPU, memory).
Patients = Pods.
Patients with critical conditions (high priority) get beds first.
If a bed is full and a critical patient arrives, a less critical patient (low priority pod) might be moved out (evicted).

PriorityClass:
A PriorityClass in Kubernetes is an object that assigns a numerical priority value to pods.
Higher value = more important pod.
It influences scheduling (which pod gets resources first) and preemption (evicting lower-priority pods when resources are scarce).

Analogy — Airport Check-in Counter ✈️
Think of Kubernetes as an airport check-in system:
Passengers = Pods.
Check-in counters = Node resources (CPU, memory).
Boarding pass class = PriorityClass.
How it works:
Passengers with First Class tickets (high priority) check in first.
Economy class passengers (low priority) wait until higher-priority passengers are served.
If the flight is full and a First Class passenger arrives, an Economy passenger might be offloaded (evicted) to make room.

Resource limit:
In Kubernetes, a resource limit is a configuration that specifies the maximum amount of CPU and memory a container can use.
If a container tries to use more CPU than its limit, Kubernetes throttles it.
If it tries to use more memory than its limit, Kubernetes may terminate (kill) the container.
Purpose:
Resource limits prevent any single container from consuming too many resources and impacting other workloads in the cluster.
Analogy:
Think of it like a speed limit for cars. No matter how powerful your engine is, you can’t go beyond the posted limit — this keeps the road safe and fair for all drivers.

Resource QoS (Quality of Service) Classes:
In Kubernetes, Resource QoS (Quality of Service) Classes are categories that determine how the kubelet prioritizes pods when resources run low on a node.
They’re decided automatically based on the CPU & memory requests and limits you set for your containers.

Three QoS Classes:
1. Guaranteed  2. Burstable   3. BestEffort

1. Guaranteed
Condition:
CPU request = CPU limit
Memory request = Memory limit
(And both are set for every container in the pod)
Behavior:
Highest priority when resources are scarce.
Least likely to be evicted.
Analogy:
Like a VIP ticket — you get a guaranteed seat and service no matter what.

2. Burstable
Condition:
Requests < Limits
Or some containers have requests but not equal to limits.
Behavior:
Gets minimum guaranteed resources but can burst up to limits if available.
Medium eviction priority.
Analogy:
Like an economy ticket with upgrade vouchers — you’re guaranteed a seat, but extra legroom only if it’s free.

3. BestEffort
Condition:
No requests and no limits set for any container in the pod.
Behavior:
Lowest priority — first to be evicted when the node runs out of resources.
Only gets leftover resources.
Analogy:
Like standing passengers in a crowded train — you get space only if nobody else needs it.

Flow: How QoS is Used
Pod Scheduling → Requests help decide placement (QoS class determined here).
Runtime → Limits control max usage.
Node under pressure → Eviction order: BestEffort → Burstable → Guaranteed.

Taints and Tolerations:
In Kubernetes, Taints and Tolerations work together to control which pods can be scheduled on which nodes — essentially a “selective access” mechanism.

Taints Definition:
A taint is applied to a node and says:
“Only pods that can tolerate this taint are allowed here; others stay away.”
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:effect
Effects:
NoSchedule → Pods without the toleration will not be scheduled here.
PreferNoSchedule → Avoid scheduling here if possible.
NoExecute → Evicts running pods that don’t tolerate the taint, and stops scheduling new ones.

Tolerations Definition:
A toleration is applied to a pod and says:
“I’m okay with this taint; you can place me there.”

Analogy:
Think of a node as a VIP lounge:
The taint is like a security guard with a list:
“Only people with a VIP pass can enter.”
The toleration is your VIP pass — if you have it, you’re allowed in.

Flow
Node gets tainted → gpu=true:NoSchedule
Scheduler checks pods → Only pods with matching toleration can be placed there.
If node is under NoExecute, non-tolerating pods get evicted.

Static Pods:
Static Pods in Kubernetes are special pods that are managed directly by the kubelet on a node, not by the Kubernetes API server or scheduler.
Key Points
Created and managed by:
The kubelet process running on the node.
No scheduler involvement:
The pod is bound to that specific node — it will not move elsewhere.
Definition location:
You define them in a manifest file stored in a directory specified by the kubelet’s --pod-manifest-path flag (e.g., /etc/kubernetes/manifests/).
Auto-recreation:
If the pod crashes, kubelet automatically restarts it.
Read-only in API:
Static pods do appear in kubectl get pods, but you cannot delete them with kubectl delete — you must remove or edit the manifest file.

Assiging pods to Nodes:
Assigning Pods to Nodes in Kubernetes is the process of influencing where a pod will run within the cluster.
By default, the Kubernetes Scheduler picks the node based on resource availability, taints/tolerations, and other constraints — but you can control the placement with specific rules.

Ways to Assign Pods to Nodes:
1️) Node Selector (Basic)  2)  Node Affinity (Advanced) 3) Pod Affinity / Anti-Affinity 4)  Taints and Tolerations 5) Custom Scheduler

1️) Node Selector (Basic):Simplest way to tell Kubernetes: "Run this pod only on nodes with a specific label."
Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
Here, the pod will run only on a node with the label disktype=ssd.

2) Node Affinity (Advanced):
More flexible and expressive than nodeSelector.
Types:
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution → Hard rule (must match to schedule).
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution → Soft rule (preferred, but not mandatory).
Example:
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: disktype
          operator: In
          values:
          - ssd

3) Pod Affinity / Anti-Affinity:
Pod Affinity → Schedule pods near (on the same node or topology) as other pods.
Pod Anti-Affinity → Keep pods away from each other for redundancy.
Example: Run pods in different zones to improve high availability

4) Taints and Tolerations
Taints → Mark a node to repel certain pods.
Tolerations → Allow pods to run on tainted nodes.
Example: Critical workloads can tolerate special “dedicated” nodes.

5) Custom Scheduler
You can run your own scheduler for highly specialized placement logic.

Analogy
Imagine Kubernetes as a hotel booking system:
Node labels = Hotel features (e.g., “ocean view”, “king bed”).
Node Selector / Affinity = Your booking request (“I want a room with an ocean view”).
Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity = You want to be close to or far from other guests.
Taints & Tolerations = VIP rooms where only special guests can stay.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Volumes: Volumes is defined in pod specification. It help to preserved pod data in case of container failures.
Volume types:
1) emptyDir
2) host path
3) configMaps
4) secrets

1) emptyDir: emptyDir volume is created when a Pod is assigned to a Node. It is initially empty, and it provides a temporary shared storage that can be accessed by all containers in that Pod.
It lives as long as the Pod lives.
It is deleted permanently when the Pod is deleted.
It is used to share data between containers in the same Pod or to store temporary files.

Note:
A container crashing does not remove a Pod from a node. The data in an emptyDir volume is safe across container crashes.

Real-life Analogy: Temporary Whiteboard in a Meeting Room
Imagine you and your teammates (containers) go into a meeting room (Pod). Inside, there is a whiteboard (emptyDir).
The whiteboard is empty when you enter.
All of you can write on it and read from it during the meeting.
The content remains while the meeting is going on.
When the meeting ends (Pod is deleted), the whiteboard is wiped clean (deleted).
This whiteboard is just like emptyDir.

To prove it.
1) emp tydir-demo.yaml is create
2) kubectl apply -f emptydir-demo
3) kubectl logs emptydir-demo -c reader
Hello from writer!
4) After 10 sec writer container will crashed. we will get the same result
5) kubectl logs emptydir-demo -c reader
Hello from writer!

2) host path: A host path volume mounts a file or directory from the node's filesystem directly into a pod.
it allows the container to access files that are on the host machine(node).
Simple Definition: host path gives the pod access to the host machine's - like a shared folder between your app and your computer.
Easy Trick to Remember: "hostPath = Host's folder shared with Pod." 

3) configMaps: A ConfigMap is used to store configuration data (like environment variables, config files, command-line arguments) separately from your application code. ConfigMap provides a way to inject configuration data into pods. The data stored in a ConfigMap can be referenced in a volume of type configMap and then consumed by containerized applications running in a pod.
📦 Real-Life Example (Easy to Remember):
Imagine you're opening a restaurant franchise.
The kitchen (app) is ready to cook.
But the menu, timings, and prices (config) are different in each city.
Instead of hardcoding this info into the kitchen equipment, you give them a printed sheet (ConfigMap) that they read when they open.
Same with ConfigMap:
Your app is the container.
ConfigMap is a separate config sheet that your app reads.
If you update the ConfigMap, the app can adapt without changing the container image.

4) secrets: A Secret in Kubernetes is used to store sensitive data, such as:
Passwords
API keys
Certificates
Tokens
It is similar to a ConfigMap but designed for confidential information — stored in base64-encoded format and with better security control.

or
A secret volume is used to pass sensitive information, such as passwords, to Pods. You can store secrets in the Kubernetes API and mount them as files for use by pods without coupling to Kubernetes directly.
A Secret is always mounted as readOnly

🔓 Real-Life Example (Easy to Remember):
Imagine a hotel with digital lockers.
Guests (pods) can ask the front desk (Kubernetes) for their locker keys (secrets).
The hotel doesn't shout out the codes — they hand over the locker in a secure way.
Only the right guest (pod) gets access.
In Kubernetes:
A pod may need a database password.
Instead of hardcoding it in the image, we store it in a Secret.
Kubernetes can mount the secret into the pod securely.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PersistentVolume:
In Kubernetes, storage is managed separately from the computing part (like Pods). The PersistentVolume feature gives a standard way to connect users to storage without them worrying about where or how it comes from.
It works with two parts:
PersistentVolume (PV) → The actual storage provided in the cluster.
PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) → A user’s request to use some of that storage.

A Persistent Volume (PV) is a piece of storage in your cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically by Kubernetes using StorageClasses.It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource.
It's independent of the pod’s lifecycle.
Think of it like a USB drive or external hard disk attached to your system — even if you restart your computer, the data is still there.

Real-Life Analogy:
🧳 Analogy: Hotel Room + Luggage
You (a pod) book a hotel room (Node) temporarily.
You bring a suitcase (Persistent Volume Claim) asking for a room with a locker.
The hotel provides you with a locker (Persistent Volume).
Even if you check out and leave, your locker with your belongings remains — and can be reassigned to another guest.

PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):
A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, ReadWriteMany, or ReadWriteOncePod,) 

or

A PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) is a request for storage made by a pod. It’s how your application says:
“Hey Kubernetes, I need a volume of 1Gi size, with this kind of access — please find me one that matches.”
Think of a PVC as a storage ticket your application gives to Kubernetes to fetch the actual volume (PV).
🧳 Real-Life Analogy:
📦 PVC = You asking for a locker
You go to a hotel reception and say, "I need a locker to store my laptop".
That request is your PVC.
The hotel finds a locker (PV) that meets your size and access needs and assigns it to you.
Once it's yours, you can access it as long as you're checked in.
Even if you switch rooms (pod restarts or moves), your locker stays intact and keeps your data.
Key Points:
PVCs are created by users/devs.
PVs are created by admins or automatically via StorageClass.
PVC binds to a suitable PV.

Access mode of persistent volume:
1) RWD (ReadWriteOnce) : The volume can only be mounted by a single node in read-write mode.
2) RDX (ReadOnlyMany) : The volume can be mounted in read-Only mode by many nodes.
3) RWX (ReadWriteMany) : The volume can be mounted in read-write mode by many nodes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Headless service:
A service with its ClusterIP set to none is known as a Headless service.
Instead of load-balancing traffic, it directly returns the DNS records (IP addresses) of the backing pods.

Real-Life Analogy:
🏢 Regular Service (LoadBalancer):
Imagine you're calling a helpdesk number. You always get routed to someone, but you don’t know who — it's load-balanced.
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Headless Service:
Instead, imagine you get a directory of every support agent, and you can call any of them directly. That’s like DNS returning the individual pod IPs — you can talk to them one by one.
✅ Why Use a Headless Service?
Stateful workloads (like databases or message queues)
Direct communication between pods, where load balancing is not desired
Useful in StatefulSets, where each pod has a stable DNS name

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

StatefulStets: A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes workload API object used to manage stateful applications — apps where each pod must have a persistent identity.
It guarantees:
Stable, unique pod names (pod-0, pod-1, etc.)
Stable storage (one volume per pod, even after restarts)
Ordered deployment, scaling, and deletion

🧳 Real-Life Analogy: Student Lockers
Imagine you're running a school. Each student:
Has a locker with their own books inside
Always uses the same locker
Has a roll number (identity) that doesn't change
Now compare this to Kubernetes:
School Element	:	Kubernetes Equivalent
Student roll	:   number	Pod name (mongo-0, etc.)
Locker			:	PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
Student			: 	Stateful pod

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

StorageClass:A StorageClass defines the “type” of storage you want for your PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). It acts like a template or profile for dynamic storage provisioning.

In simple words:
A StorageClass tells Kubernetes how to create storage when a pod asks for it.
You don’t need to create the volume manually (like a PV) — Kubernetes will automatically create and attach the right volume based on the StorageClass.

Real-Life Analogy:
Cloud Disk Booking System
Imagine you’re using a cloud platform (like AWS or GCP) and you say:
“I need 20 GB of storage that is fast (SSD).”
You don’t care which disk or where it comes from, just that it matches your requirement.
StorageClass is the pre-defined template (SSD, HDD, encrypted, etc.) and Kubernetes dynamically provisions the disk for you.

Why is it Useful?
Automates volume provisioning
Different workloads can use different types of storage (fast, slow, replicated)
Helps you scale stateful workloads easily.

Summary:
Component						Purpose								Analogy
PersistentVolume (PV)			Actual storage						A locker
PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)		Request for storage					A student requesting locker
StorageClass					Type/template of storage			Locker type (small/large)

==============================================================================================================================================

Securing the Cluster:
Securing the Cluster in Kubernetes means implementing practices, configurations, and tools to protect your cluster from unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious workloads.
Think of your Kubernetes cluster like a city — you have gates, guards, and rules to keep it safe. Securing it means making sure only the right people and safe workloads get in, and that everything inside behaves as expected.

Main Areas of Kubernetes Cluster Security
1. API Server Security (Gatekeeper of the Cluster)
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) → Give users and services only the permissions they need.
Authentication → Verify who is making the request (certificates, OIDC, service accounts).
Authorization → Decide what they can do (Roles, ClusterRoles).
API Auditing → Keep logs of all API calls for investigation.
Analogy: The city hall has an entry register — only certain people can enter specific rooms.

2. Network Security
Network Policies → Control which pods/services can talk to each other.
Restrict External Access → Avoid exposing unnecessary ports via NodePort or LoadBalancer.
Ingress Controller Security → Use HTTPS/TLS for secure communication.
Analogy: Security gates between neighborhoods so only approved visitors can enter.

3. Pod & Container Security
Pod Security Standards / OPA Gatekeeper → Enforce rules like “No root user”, “Read-only filesystem”.
Image Security → Use trusted images, scan them with tools like Trivy or Anchore.
Resource Limits → Prevent pods from consuming all CPU/memory (avoids DoS from inside).
Analogy: Citizens can live in the city, but they must have an ID, follow laws, and not take unlimited resources.

4. Node Security
Harden OS → Disable unused ports, apply patches.
Limit SSH Access → Only allow admin-level people to access worker/master nodes.
Run minimal software → Reduce attack surface.
Analogy: Guard the city gates and infrastructure from intruders.

5. Secret Management
Kubernetes Secrets → Store passwords, tokens securely (better with encryption at rest).
External Secret Managers → AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault.
Avoid hardcoding credentials in configs.
Analogy: Keep city’s master keys in a locked safe, not lying around.

6. Monitoring & Auditing
Logging → Capture application and system logs.
Monitoring → Use Prometheus, Grafana, ELK to detect anomalies.
Audit Logs → Track changes to cluster resources.
Analogy: CCTV cameras and patrol logs in the city.

7. Regular Updates
Keep Kubernetes version up to date.
Apply security patches to nodes and container images.

Proccess flow: [Authentication] → [Authorization (RBAC)] → [Admission Control]
Authentication: Verifies identity (ID check).
Authorization: Checks permissions (Are you allowed in this room?).
Admission Control: Applies extra rules before allowing the request.

What is the Authentication in Kubernetes:
Authentication is the first security gate — it’s all about proving who you are before you can talk to the Kubernetes API server.

Analogy: Imagine you’re entering a secure office building. The guard won’t let you in until you show ID proof (badge, fingerprint, or access card). Authentication is that “ID check.”

Purpose:
Ensure that only verified entities (humans, applications, nodes) can access the cluster.
Prevent anonymous or unauthorized access.

Who Needs Authentication?
Human users → Developers, admins, operators.
Service accounts → Applications running inside the cluster.
Kubelet / Nodes → Worker nodes communicating with API server.

Authentication Methods
Kubernetes supports multiple ways to prove identity:
1) Certificates (X.509 TLS)
Common for node-to-API server communication.
Example: kubelet authenticates using a client certificate.

2) Bearer Tokens
Static tokens (defined in API server config).
Service account tokens (auto-mounted in pods).

3) OpenID Connect (OIDC)
Uses external identity providers like Google, Okta, Azure AD.

4) Webhook Token Authentication
API server sends credentials to an external authentication service.

5) Bootstrap Tokens
Used when adding new nodes to the cluster.

What is Authorization in Kubernetes?
In Kubernetes security, Authorization comes after Authentication — it’s about deciding what an authenticated user (or service) is allowed to do.
If Authentication is the building’s security guard checking your ID, Authorization is the office receptionist deciding which floors/rooms you can enter based on your access level.
You may be allowed into the building (authenticated),
but you might not be allowed into the server room (authorized).

Purpose
Controls permissions for every request to the Kubernetes API.
Ensures least privilege: give only the rights needed to do the job.

How Authorization Works
When a request reaches the API Server:
1) Authentication → Verifies who you are.
2) Authorization → Checks what you are allowed to do.
3) Admission Control → Applies extra policies if needed.

Authorization Modes in Kubernetes
Kubernetes supports multiple authorization modules (you can enable more than one):
1) RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) ✅ (most common)
Uses Roles and RoleBindings to allow actions (verbs) on resources.
Example:
Role: get, list, watch Pods in namespace dev.
RoleBinding: Assigns that role to a user/service account.

2) ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
Policies based on user attributes and request parameters.
Less common now; RBAC is preferred.

3) Node Authorization
Special rules for kubelets (nodes) to access API server resources.

4) Webhook Authorization
Delegates the authorization decision to an external service.

RBAC Example (Interview-Friendly)
# Role: Read-only access to Pods
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: dev
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]

# Binding: Assigns the above role to user 'alice'
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: read-pods-binding
  namespace: dev
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: alice
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

Here:
Alice can view pods in dev namespace,
but she cannot create/delete them.

✅ In short:
Authorization is the permission checker of Kubernetes. Even if you’ve proven your identity, you’ll only be allowed to perform actions if your authorization rules (RBAC, ABAC, etc.) permit it.

Authentication checks who you are (identity verification) — like showing your ID at the building entrance. Authorization checks what you’re allowed to do (permission control) — like deciding which floors or rooms you can enter after you’re inside.
Role — The Permission List:
Definition: A Role defines a set of permissions (rules) within a specific namespace.
Purpose: Says what actions can be performed on which resources.
Scope: Namespace-scoped (applies only to one namespace).

RoleBinding — Giving the Permission to Someone:
Definition: A RoleBinding attaches (binds) a Role to a user, group, or service account.
Purpose: Says who can use the permissions defined in the Role.
Scope: Also namespace-scoped.

Key Points
Role → Defines permissions (verbs + resources).
RoleBinding → Assigns those permissions to users, groups, or service accounts.
For cluster-wide permissions, we use ClusterRole & ClusterRoleBinding instead.

User: Bind the role to a single user in cluster.
Service account: Bind the role to a single Service account in a namespace.
Group: Bind the role to a group of user/service accounts in the cluster.

Network Policy:
Network Policy in Kubernetes is a set of rules that define how Pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints.

It specifies:
Which Pods can receive traffic (Ingress rules)
Which Pods can send traffic (Egress rules)
Conditions for communication (based on labels, namespaces, IP blocks, and ports)

Key Points:
Works at Layer 3/4 (IP and port level).
Requires a CNI plugin that supports network policies (e.g., Calico, Cilium).
By default, all Pods can communicate freely — applying a network policy starts denying traffic not explicitly allowed.

 Office Wi-Fi & Access List Analogy

Think of your Kubernetes cluster as a big office building with multiple Wi-Fi networks (Pods).
By default, every employee’s laptop can connect to every Wi-Fi network.
A Network Policy is like the IT department’s Wi-Fi access list:
They decide which laptops (Pods) can connect to which Wi-Fi networks (other Pods).
They can also block certain laptops from accessing the internet (Egress).
If your laptop isn’t on the approved list, you can’t connect — even if the network exists.
It’s basically custom Wi-Fi permissions for Pod communication.

Network Policy using Calico in Kubernetes:
Network Policy using Calico in Kubernetes means using Calico (a popular Kubernetes networking and security plugin) to enforce traffic control rules between Pods, Namespaces, and external endpoints.

What is a Network Policy?
A Kubernetes NetworkPolicy is a set of rules that define which Pods can talk to which other Pods/services and on which ports/protocols.
By default in Kubernetes:
All Pods can talk to all other Pods (open network).
NetworkPolicy restricts that traffic to only what’s explicitly allowed.

Where Calico Comes In
Kubernetes itself only defines the NetworkPolicy API — it doesn’t enforce it.
Calico is one of the most widely used CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins that:
Reads Kubernetes NetworkPolicy objects.
Applies them at the network layer using iptables or eBPF.
Supports both Kubernetes native policies and Calico-specific extended policies (more features like deny rules, global policies, etc.).

How It Works
You create a NetworkPolicy YAML in Kubernetes.
Kubernetes stores it in etcd via the API server.
Calico agents (running on every node as a DaemonSet) watch for new policies.
Calico translates policies into low-level rules (iptables/eBPF) on the node’s network stack.
These rules are applied at the pod’s virtual network interface — filtering traffic before it even reaches the pod.

Example — Allow Only Frontend to Talk to Backend
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-to-backend
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80

Meaning: Only Pods labeled app=frontend can send TCP traffic to Pods labeled app=backend on port 80.

Analogy
Think of Calico NetworkPolicy as:
Rules: “Only people from the Marketing department can enter the Design office, and only through the main door.”
Kubernetes: Writes down the rules.
Calico: Places security guards at every office door to enforce them in real-time.

Why Calico is Popular
Supports eBPF (faster packet filtering than iptables).
More expressive policies (deny rules, global scope).
Works for both pod-to-pod and pod-to-external communication.
Can also handle encryption and BGP-based routing.

iptables in Calico:
What it is
iptables is the traditional Linux firewall utility for packet filtering and network address translation (NAT).
Calico can use iptables rules to control which packets are allowed/denied based on Kubernetes NetworkPolicies.
How Calico uses it
When a NetworkPolicy is applied, Calico generates iptables rules.
These rules are inserted into the Linux networking stack to enforce security policies.
Works well but can become slower for large clusters because iptables rules grow linearly with the number of pods/services.
Analogy
Think of iptables like a security guard with a big clipboard — every packet is checked against a long list of rules. If the list gets too long, the guard slows down.

eBPF in Calico:
What it is
eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a modern Linux kernel technology that lets you run custom programs inside the kernel without changing kernel code.
It's faster, more flexible, and avoids some of the scalability issues of iptables.
How Calico uses it
Instead of inserting many iptables rules, Calico runs eBPF programs inside the kernel.
This allows direct packet processing, faster policy checks, and better observability.
Can replace kube-proxy for service handling, reducing network hops and latency.
Analogy
Think of eBPF like a smart AI security camera installed right at the gate — it instantly recognizes whether to allow or block someone, without flipping through a long paper list.

=============================================================================================================================================
Logging and Monitoring the cluster:
EFK Stack:
The EFK stack is a logging and monitoring solution used to collect, store, and visualize logs from your applications and Kubernetes cluster.
It consists of three main components:

🔹 E = Elasticsearch
A search and analytics engine.
Stores logs in a structured way so they can be quickly searched and analyzed.
Think of it like a huge smart filing cabinet where all your logs are stored and indexed.

🔹 F = Fluentd
A log collector and forwarder.
Collects logs from applications, nodes, or containers and then sends them to Elasticsearch.
Works like a postman: it picks up all the log letters and delivers them to Elasticsearch.

🔹 K = Kibana
A visualization tool for Elasticsearch data.
Provides dashboards, graphs, and search queries so you can analyze logs in real time.
Think of it as a control room monitor where you can see what’s happening in your system.

⚙️ Process Flow (Analogy)
Imagine a company office:
Fluentd (Postman): Collects letters (logs) from all departments (apps/nodes) and delivers them.
Elasticsearch (Filing Cabinet): Files and indexes all the letters so you can quickly find them later.
Kibana (Reception Desk Monitor): Lets the manager see all the letters, trends, and alerts on a dashboard.

EFK is widely used in Kubernetes for centralized logging so DevOps engineers can troubleshoot issues quickly and monitor system health.

EFK vs ELK Stack:
Both stacks are used for centralized logging in Kubernetes and DevOps, but the difference lies in the middle component.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana)
E = Elasticsearch → stores and indexes logs.
L = Logstash → log pipeline tool (ingests, processes, transforms logs before sending them to Elasticsearch).
K = Kibana → visualization dashboard.

Pros(Advantage):
Very powerful for log processing and transformation.
Can handle complex parsing and enrichment of logs.

Cons(Disadvantage):
Logstash is heavy, requires more resources (CPU/RAM).
Slower compared to Fluentd.
More difficult to scale in Kubernetes.

EFK Stack (Elasticsearch + Fluentd + Kibana)
E = Elasticsearch → same as above.
F = Fluentd → lightweight log collector/forwarder.
K = Kibana → same as above.

Pros(Advantage):
Fluentd is lightweight, efficient, and Kubernetes-native.
Works seamlessly with Kubernetes (via DaemonSets to collect pod logs).
Scales better in cloud-native environments.
Supports structured logs (JSON, etc.) easily.

Cons(Disadvantage):
Less powerful than Logstash for heavy transformations (but often enough for most use cases).

 Summary Table:

| Feature              | ELK (Logstash)    | EFK (Fluentd)             |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Log Collector        | Logstash (heavy)  | Fluentd (lightweight)     |
| Resource Usage       | High              | Low                       |
| Integration with K8s | Not native        | Native                    |
| Scalability          | Harder            | Easier                    |
| Log Transformation   | Very Powerful     | Good but limited          |
| Best for             | Complex pipelines | Kubernetes & Cloud-native |

What is Kubernetes Monitoring?
Kubernetes Monitoring means observing and tracking everything that is happening inside a Kubernetes cluster — the nodes, pods, containers, and applications — so that you know:
Are the apps running fine?
Are resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) being used properly?
Are there any failures or slowdowns?
Do you need to scale up/down the workloads?
In short, Kubernetes Monitoring = keeping the health check of the cluster and applications.

Real-world Analogy:
Think of Kubernetes as a big hospital 🏥:
Nodes = Hospital buildings
Pods/Containers = Doctors and staff working inside
Applications = The medical services provided

Now, monitoring is like having a control room with CCTV + dashboards + alarms:
It shows how many doctors are available (pod counts)
Whether a doctor is overloaded with patients (CPU/Memory usage)
If a ward is full or down (node status)
Alerts if something goes wrong 🚨
This way, you don’t wait for the hospital to collapse — you detect issues early and fix them.

How Kubernetes Monitoring Works
Metrics Collection → Collect data (CPU, memory, network, pod states).
Tools: Prometheus, cAdvisor, Metrics Server
Visualization → Show data in graphs and dashboards.

Tool: Grafana
Logging → Capture application/system logs.
Tools: EFK/ELK stack
Alerting → Notify when something is wrong.
Tools: Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana alerts, Slack/Email alerts
Kubernetes Monitoring = Metrics + Logs + Alerts to keep the cluster and apps healthy.

What is the top command in Kubernetes?
The kubectl top command is used to view real-time resource usage (CPU and memory) of nodes and pods in your cluster
Check Node usage:
kubectl top nodes/pods
Example output:
NAME       CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
nodeA      250m         12%    1024Mi          35%
nodeB      400m         20%    2048Mi          50%

Full Metrics Pipeline in Kubernetes:
The metrics pipeline is the complete flow of resource usage data (CPU, memory, etc.) from pods/nodes → Kubernetes API → monitoring tools → visualization/alerts.
Steps in the Pipeline
1) Metrics Collection (Raw Data Gathering):
Resource usage data is collected from Kubelets (agents running on nodes).
Each Kubelet has a component called cAdvisor that gathers CPU, memory, network, and filesystem usage from containers.

2) Metrics Aggregation
The data from all nodes is sent to the Metrics Server.
Metrics Server aggregates this real-time usage data.
Example:
Metrics Server combines pod stats from nodeA + nodeB → makes it available to kubectl top.

3) Metrics API (Kubernetes API)
Metrics Server exposes the data through Kubernetes Metrics API.
This API is what tools like kubectl top and the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) use.

4) Monitoring Systems (Long-term Storage + Alerts)
Real-time metrics are stored for historical analysis in monitoring tools like:
Prometheus (time-series DB + alerting)
Thanos / Cortex (long-term Prometheus storage)
Example:
Prometheus scrapes metrics every 15s and stores them → You can query CPU usage from last week.

5) Visualization
Metrics are visualized on dashboards using:
Grafana (most popular)
Kibana (for logs)
Example:
Grafana dashboard shows CPU/memory usage trend of a pod over the last 7 days.

6) Alerting & Autoscaling
Based on metrics, you can:
✅ Trigger alerts (via Prometheus Alertmanager → Slack, Email, PagerDuty).
✅ Perform autoscaling (HPA scales pods up/down based on metrics).

Flow Summary
cAdvisor (inside Kubelet) → collects raw metrics.	
Kubelet → exposes metrics.
Metrics Server → aggregates metrics.
Kubernetes Metrics API → provides metrics to kubectl top, HPA.
Prometheus → stores historical metrics.
Grafana → visualizes metrics.
Alertmanager/HPA → acts on metrics.

Analogy
Think of this like a hospital monitoring system 🏥:
cAdvisor = Nurses taking vitals (CPU, memory readings).
Metrics Server = Reception that collects all vitals.
Metrics API = Records book that doctors check for latest vitals.
Prometheus = Hospital database that stores vitals over time.
Grafana = Dashboard screens in ICU showing patient health trends.
Alertmanager/HPA = Alarm system that beeps if vitals cross threshold.

What is etcd?
etcd is the key-value store used by Kubernetes.
It stores all the cluster’s state data (pods, configs, secrets, nodes, roles, etc.).
It’s the source of truth for Kubernetes.
Without etcd → Kubernetes forgets everything after restart.

etcd Operations:
We can group operations into basic and advanced:
1. Basic CRUD Operations
etcd is like a database — so it supports CRUD:
Create (PUT) → Store new key-value data
etcdctl put /registry/pods/default/nginx '{"pod":"nginx"}'

Read (GET) → Retrieve data
etcdctl get /registry/pods/default/nginx

Update (PUT again) → Modify existing key
etcdctl put /registry/pods/default/nginx '{"pod":"nginx", "status":"Running"}'

Delete (DEL) → Remove a key
etcdctl del /registry/pods/default/nginx

2. Watch Operation
etcd allows clients to watch for changes on keys.
Kubernetes uses this heavily → controllers "watch" etcd for changes.
Example:
If you delete a pod, controllers watching etcd will see the change and create a replacement.
etcdctl watch /registry/pods/default/nginx

3. List Operation
You can list multiple keys under a prefix.
Example:
etcdctl get /registry/pods --prefix

4. Snapshot Operation
Used for backup & restore of cluster state.
Example:
Backup etcd:
etcdctl snapshot save backup.db

Restore from snapshot:
etcdctl snapshot restore backup.db

5. Cluster Management Operations
If running etcd in HA mode:
Member Add / Remove (scale etcd cluster)
Member List (see all etcd nodes)
Defragmentation (optimize storage)
Example:
etcdctl member list
etcdctl defrag

Analogy
Think of etcd like a central registry office 📚:
Every document (Pod, Service, ConfigMap) is recorded there.
Create = Adding a new record
Read = Looking up a record
Update = Changing details in a record
Delete = Removing the record
Watch = Having a clerk notify you if a record changes
Snapshot = Taking a backup of the registry books 

In short:
etcd operations = CRUD + Watch + Snapshot + Cluster mgmt → They ensure Kubernetes always knows the desired and current state of the cluster.

Kubernetes API Server ↔ etcd Communication:
The API Server is the front door to Kubernetes.
It never stores data itself → instead, it reads/writes cluster state in etcd.
Step-by-Step Flow
1. kubectl apply (Create Pod Example)
kubectl sends the request → API Server.

2. API Server Validates
API Server checks the YAML manifest:
✅ Syntax correct
✅ User has permission (RBAC check)
✅ Schema validation

3. API Server Writes to etcd
If valid → API Server saves object into etcd.
Example: /registry/pods/default/nginx gets created with full Pod spec.
etcd = source of truth now knows:

4. Controllers Watch etcd
Controllers (like the Scheduler and ReplicaSet Controller) are constantly watching etcd via the API Server.
When they see the new Pod:
Scheduler assigns it to a Node.
Scheduler updates Pod’s info → API Server → etcd.

5. Kubelet Reads from API Server
Kubelet (on the assigned node) watches API Server.
When it sees a Pod scheduled to its node:
It creates containers using Docker/containerd.
Reports back status → API Server → etcd updated.

What is ETCD Operations using Etcdadm and Etcdctl?
When working with etcd in Kubernetes, you mainly use two tools:
etcdctl → CLI to interact with etcd (day-to-day operations like backup, restore, get, put).
etcdadm → Tool to bootstrap and manage etcd clusters (like kubeadm for Kubernetes).

ETCD Operations
1. Using etcdctl (Day-to-Day Admin)
etcdctl is like your remote control for an etcd cluster.
It interacts with etcd’s key-value store and helps with operational tasks.
Common etcdctl commands:
1) Set & Get keys (like a database)
etcdctl put foo "Hello ETCD"
etcdctl get foo
2) List all keys
etcdctl get "" --prefix --keys-only
3) Backup (snapshot)
etcdctl snapshot save /tmp/backup.db
4) Restore from backup
etcdctl snapshot restore /tmp/backup.db --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-restored
5) Cluster health check
etcdctl endpoint health
6) Member management
etcdctl member list
👉 Think of etcdctl as the “doctor and database client” → check health, insert data, backup, restore.

2. Using etcdadm (Cluster Bootstrap & Lifecycle)
etcdadm is like kubeadm but for etcd.
It helps bootstrap, configure, and manage etcd clusters without manually writing systemd files.
Common etcdadm operations:
1) Bootstrap a new etcd cluster
etcdadm init
Creates a new single-node cluster, generates certs, config, and systemd service.
2) Join a new member
etcdadm join https://<existing-member>:2380
3) Remove a member
etcdadm remove <member-id>
4) Upgrade etcd
etcdadm upgrade
5) Check cluster status
etcdadm member list
Think of etcdadm as the “installer & cluster manager”, while etcdctl is the day-to-day operator tool.

Analogy – Restaurant 🍽️
etcdadm = Restaurant Builder 🏗️
Sets up kitchen, staff, and dining tables (initial setup, scaling, upgrades).
etcdctl = Chef’s Tools & Daily Operations 🔪
Cooking, serving dishes, taking orders, cleaning (backup, restore, health checks).

✅ Summary:
etcdctl → Manage data & health (CRUD operations, snapshots, restore, member list, health).
etcdadm → Manage cluster lifecycle (bootstrap, join, remove, upgrade).

What is Helm?
Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes.
Just like apt (Ubuntu), yum (RHEL/CentOS), or npm (Node.js) install and manage software packages on their systems,
Helm installs and manages applications inside Kubernetes clusters.
Instead of manually writing long YAML manifests for Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Ingress, etc., Helm bundles them into charts (reusable templates).

How Helm Works
1)Helm Chart → A packaged set of YAML files describing how to deploy an app.
Example: A Helm chart for MySQL includes Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, PVC.
2)Helm Repository → A place where charts are stored (like Docker Hub, but for Helm).
3)Helm CLI (client) → You use commands like:
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install mydb bitnami/mysql
→ This installs MySQL with all required Kubernetes resources.
4)Tiller (removed in Helm v3) → Earlier versions used a server-side component, now Helm directly interacts with the Kubernetes API.

Key Features of Helm
Package Management: Bundle apps as charts.
Versioning: Rollback to previous versions easily.
Templating: Reuse configs across environments (dev, test, prod).
Sharing: Publish and consume charts from repos.
Upgrades: Update applications with a single command.

Analogy – Restaurant 🍽️
Think of Kubernetes as a big kitchen 🍳 and applications as dishes.
Without Helm → You, as a chef, have to prepare everything from scratch:
Buy ingredients separately (Deployment YAML, Service YAML, PVC YAML).
Cook them in the right order (apply configs in sequence).
Risk of missing steps.
With Helm → You get a recipe book (Helm Chart):
Recipe already includes ingredients + instructions.
Just say: "Make me a Pizza 🍕" → Kitchen (Kubernetes) prepares it with all the correct steps.
If you want extra cheese → just change one variable in the recipe values file (values.yaml).
Helm = Your master chef assistant that automates and standardizes complex cooking (app deployment).

Real Example:
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install myblog bitnami/wordpress

✅ In just 1 command, you deploy WordPress with:
Deployment (Pods for WordPress + MySQL)
Services (to connect)
PVC (storage for DB & content)
ConfigMaps (env vars)
Secrets (passwords)
Without Helm → You would write 300+ lines of YAML!

In short:
Helm = App Store + Recipe Book for Kubernetes.
It gives you pre-built, configurable packages (charts) so you can install apps in minutes instead of hours.

Analogy (Restaurant Menu 🍽️)
Chart.yaml → Menu card title (Dish name: “Pizza Special”)
values.yaml → Your choices (extra cheese, spicy level, size = medium)
templates/ → Recipe instructions (how to bake pizza, how long to cook, toppings placement)
charts/ → Extra items needed (side dish like garlic bread 🍞 or Coke 🥤)
Finally, the chef (Kubernetes) takes the recipe, applies your preferences, and serves you the dish (running application).

Troubleshooting Kubernetes.
Kubernetes: Type of failure:
1) Application Failure
2) Node Failure
3) Cluster failures
4) Control Plane failure
5) Networking failure

1) Application Failure Troubleshooting
Common Symptoms

Pod stuck in CrashLoopBackOff
Pod stuck in ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull
Pod stuck in Pending
Pod stuck in Terminating
Container OOMKilled (out of memory)
Application not responding even though Pod is Running

Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Flow:
i)Check Pod Status
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
Look at the STATUS column (Running, Pending, CrashLoopBackOff, etc.).

ii) Describe the Pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
Look for Events at the bottom:
Image not found → registry issue.
FailedScheduling → no resources on node.
Volume mount errors → PVC not bound.

iii) Check Pod Logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
If multiple containers:
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name> -n <namespace>
Identify application-level issues (bad config, missing env variables, crash due to code bug).

iv) Check Previous Logs (for CrashLoopBackOff)
kubectl logs --previous <pod-name> -c <container-name>
Shows logs before the container crashed.

v) Exec into the Pod (if it’s running but misbehaving)
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
Check connectivity, config files, or environment variables inside the container.

vi) Verify ConfigMaps & Secrets
Application failures often come from misconfigured environment data.
kubectl describe configmap <name> -n <namespace>
kubectl describe secret <name> -n <namespace>

vii) Check Resource Limits
Pod may be OOMKilled or throttled if limits are too low.
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep -A5 "Limits"
kubectl top pod <pod-name>

viii) Check Events in Namespace
kubectl get events -n <namespace> --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
Useful for Pending pods (insufficient resources, PVC errors).

ix) If Application is Running but Not Accessible
kubectl get svc -n <namespace>
Verify Ingress/DNS:
kubectl describe ingress <name> -n <namespace>
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- curl <service-name>:<port>

| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Image Pull Error        | `ImagePullBackOff`          | Check image name, registry, secret.           |
| CrashLoopBackOff        | Pod keeps restarting        | Check logs (`--previous`), configs, env vars. |
| Pending Pod             | Stuck in `Pending`          | Check node resources, PVC binding.            |
| Terminating Pod         | Stuck terminating           | Check finalizers, force delete.               |
| OOMKilled               | Pod killed due to memory    | Check resource limits, increase memory.       |
| Application Unreachable | Pod `Running` but no access | Check service, ingress, DNS.                  |

2) Node Failure Troubleshooting:
Common Symptoms
Node status shows NotReady
Pods on the node are Pending / Evicted / Unknown
Node under DiskPressure / MemoryPressure / PIDPressure
Kubelet not running / crashed
Node unreachable due to network issues

Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Flow

i) Check Node Status
kubectl get nodes
STATUS column shows → Ready, NotReady, SchedulingDisabled.

ii) Describe the Node
kubectl describe node <node-name>
Look for:
Conditions: MemoryPressure, DiskPressure, PIDPressure, NetworkUnavailable.
Events: Why kubelet marked it unhealthy.

iii) Check Resource Usage
kubectl top node
See if CPU or memory usage is very high.
A node with resource exhaustion will stop scheduling pods.

iv) Check System Pods Running on Node
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide | grep <node-name>
If kube-proxy, coredns, cni plugins are failing → networking will break.

v) SSH Into the Node
Check if kubelet is running:
systemctl status kubelet
Restart if needed:
systemctl restart kubelet
Check container runtime (Docker / containerd):
systemctl status docker
systemctl status containerd

vi) Verify Disk Space
df -h
If disk is full, kubelet may evict pods.

vii)
Check Networking
Can the node reach the API server?
ping <api-server-ip>
Firewall / CNI issues can isolate a node.

viii)
Cordoning & Draining (if node is bad)
Prevent new pods from scheduling:
kubectl cordon <node-name>
Move existing pods to healthy nodes:
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --force

ix)
Replace the Node (if unrecoverable)
In cloud: terminate & recreate instance (node will rejoin).
In bare metal: fix hardware or reinstall kubelet.

| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Node NotReady       | Node status NotReady        | `kubectl describe node`, check kubelet & runtime logs |
| Resource Exhaustion | DiskPressure, OOM           | `kubectl top node`, clear space, adjust limits        |
| Kubelet Failure     | Pods not reporting          | `systemctl status kubelet`, restart service           |
| Network Issues      | Pod communication fails     | Check CNI, kube-proxy logs, ping API server           |
| Disk Full           | Pods evicted                | `df -h`, clean up logs/images                         |
| Node Unreachable    | Control plane loses contact | Check VM/host status, cloud provider logs             |

Cluster Failure Troubleshooting
A Cluster Failure means the entire Kubernetes cluster or its fundamental state is impacted, not just a single node, pod, or control plane component.
It’s broader than Application, Node, or Networking failures.

Common Symptoms
kubectl commands fail on all nodes.
No workloads are scheduling on any node.
etcd data corruption → entire cluster state lost.
Certificate expiry → all nodes cannot talk to API server.
CNI (network plugin) misconfiguration → no pod-to-pod communication cluster-wide.
Misconfigured cluster DNS → all services fail resolution.
Cluster bootstrap/join failure (new nodes can’t join).

Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Flow:

i) Check Cluster Info
kubectl cluster-info
Confirms if API server and DNS are reachable.

ii) Check Node Status (Cluster-Wide)
kubectl get nodes -o wide
If all nodes are NotReady → cluster networking or cert issue.

iii) Check System Pods (kube-system Namespace)
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
Look for failed CoreDNS, kube-proxy, CNI plugin pods.
If they fail everywhere → cluster-level networking issue.

iv) Check etcd Cluster Health
etcdctl endpoint health
etcdctl member list
etcd corruption = entire cluster state gone.
If quorum lost → control plane unavailable.
Restore from etcd backup if required.

v) Check Certificates
TLS certs expiring causes all nodes to fail API server communication.
kubeadm certs check-expiration
Renew if expired:
kubeadm certs renew all

vi) Check Networking / CNI
If pods across all nodes can’t communicate:
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide | grep cni
Restart/redeploy CNI plugin (Calico, Flannel, Cilium).

vii) Check Cluster Events
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
Look for cluster-wide failures (e.g., network plugin errors, admission controller failures).

viii) Cloud / Infrastructure Issues
In managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS):
Check control plane health in cloud console.
In on-prem / self-managed:
Check VMs, network routes, firewall rules.

ix) Recovery
Restart master components (kubelet, docker/containerd).
Restore etcd backup if cluster state is gone.
Re-deploy cluster networking plugin if misconfigured.
Rotate TLS certificates if expired.

Quick Cheat Sheet (Interview-Friendly)
| **Cluster Failure Cause**         | **Symptom**                     | **Fix / Troubleshoot**                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **etcd Corruption**               | Cluster state lost, API down    | `etcdctl` health check, restore from backup |
| **Certificate Expiry**            | Nodes can’t talk to API server  | `kubeadm certs renew all`                   |
| **CNI Plugin Misconfig**          | Pod-to-pod communication broken | Restart/redeploy CNI pods                   |
| **CoreDNS Failure**               | Service DNS resolution broken   | Check `coredns` logs, scale up              |
| **API Server Down (all masters)** | Entire cluster unresponsive     | Restart kubelet, check static pod manifests |
| **Infra/Cloud Issue**             | All nodes NotReady              | Verify VM/Cloud provider status             |

In short: Cluster Failures = everything is impacted.
You troubleshoot by checking API server, etcd, certificates, networking plugins, and DNS.

4) Control Plane Failure Troubleshooting:
The Control Plane = the brain of Kubernetes.
It includes API Server, etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager.
If these fail, the whole cluster may stop working properly.

Common Symptoms
kubectl commands fail (connection refused, timeout, 401 Unauthorized).
New pods are not scheduled even though nodes are ready.
Cluster state not updating (replicasets, jobs not progressing).
Existing workloads run, but scaling/healing is broken.
etcd crashes → cluster data unavailable or corrupted.
.
Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Flow
i) Check Control Plane Pods
(on master node or via kube-system namespace)
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
Look for:
kube-apiserver
kube-scheduler
kube-controller-manager
etcd
If any are CrashLoopBackOff → control plane failure.

ii) Check API Server Health
kubectl get --raw='/healthz'
kubectl get --raw='/readyz?verbose'
/healthz → checks liveness.
/readyz → checks readiness of API server.
If fails → check API server logs:
kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-apiserver-<node-name>

iii) Check etcd Health
etcd stores cluster state. If it fails, cluster is broken.
On master node:
etcdctl endpoint health
etcdctl member list
Ensure quorum (majority of etcd members are healthy).
If corrupted, restore from backup.

iv) Check Scheduler
If pods are Pending but nodes are free → Scheduler may be down.
kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-scheduler-<node-name>

v) Check Controller Manager
If scaling/self-healing not working → Controller Manager failure.
kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-controller-manager-<node-name>

vi) Systemd Services on Master Node
If kube-system pods aren’t running (static pods), check services:
systemctl status kubelet
docker ps | grep kube-apiserver
Control plane components are usually static pods managed by kubelet.
If kubelet is down, control plane pods won’t run.

vii) Certificates & Authentication
Expired TLS certificates → API server rejects connections.
Check expiry:
kubeadm certs check-expiration
Renew if needed:
kubeadm certs renew all

viii) Networking Issues
Ensure master node can reach worker nodes.
Firewall rules not blocking port 6443 (API server).

ix) Recovery Steps
Restart kubelet on master:
systemctl restart kubelet
If etcd is down → restore from latest backup.
If control plane pod corrupted → recreate static pod manifest (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/).
For multi-master HA setup, failover to another healthy master.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Server**         | `kubectl` not working, 401 errors     | Check `kube-apiserver` pod/logs, TLS certs, port 6443 |
| **etcd**               | Cluster state lost, pods not updating | `etcdctl endpoint health`, restore from backup        |
| **Scheduler**          | Pods stuck `Pending`                  | Check `kube-scheduler` logs                           |
| **Controller Manager** | Scaling/healing not working           | Check `kube-controller-manager` logs                  |
| **Kubelet on master**  | All control plane pods fail           | Restart kubelet, check static pod manifests           |
| **Cert Expiry**        | API server rejects requests           | `kubeadm certs check-expiration`, renew certs         |


Networking Failure Troubleshooting in Kubernetes
Networking is the circulatory system of Kubernetes – if it breaks, nothing communicates properly.
It covers Pod-to-Pod, Pod-to-Service, Node-to-Pod, External access.
Common Symptoms
Pods can’t talk to each other (cross-node or even same node).
Services not reachable (Connection refused, Timeout).
kubectl exec into a pod → DNS resolution fails.
LoadBalancer/Ingress not exposing applications
Nodes show NotReady (if kubelet can’t talk to API server).

Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Flow:
i) Check Node Network Status
kubectl get nodes -o wide
If nodes are NotReady → could be kubelet ↔ API server networking issue.
Check cloud routes / firewall.

ii) Check CNI Plugin Pods
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep -E 'cni|calico|flannel|cilium|weave'
If CNI pods are CrashLoopBackOff → cluster-wide networking down.
Restart/redeploy CNI.

iii) Pod-to-Pod Communication
kubectl run test1 --image=busybox:1.28 -- sleep 3600
kubectl run test2 --image=busybox:1.28 -- sleep 3600
Ping test:
kubectl exec -it test1 -- ping <test2_pod_IP>
If fail → CNI misconfig or firewall issue.

iv) Pod-to-Service Communication
kubectl run curlpod --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -it
curl <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
If DNS fails → check CoreDNS.
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
kubectl logs -n kube-system <coredns-pod>

v) Node-to-Pod Communication
From a worker node:
curl http://<pod-IP>:<port>
If it fails, check iptables/ipvs rules (kube-proxy).

vi) External Access (Ingress / LoadBalancer)
For LoadBalancer service:
kubectl get svc -n <namespace>
Check cloud provider load balancer health.
For Ingress:
kubectl describe ingress <ingress-name>
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx <nginx-controller-pod>

vii) kube-proxy Health
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-proxy -o wide
kubectl logs -n kube-system <kube-proxy-pod>
Misconfigured kube-proxy = broken Services/ClusterIP.

viii) Cloud / Firewall / Routes
In cloud clusters (EKS, GKE, AKS), check VPC routes, security groups, firewalls.
On-prem, check iptables, firewalld, or calico network policies.

Recovery Steps
Restart CNI plugin pods.
Restart kube-proxy.
Scale/restart CoreDNS if DNS resolution is broken.
Redeploy CNI if configs got corrupted.
Fix firewall / routing rules between nodes.
